## Our Goal

We seek commercial and research partnerships that are mutually beneficial, drive business growth, and create a flywheel effect—where each collaboration accelerates our innovation, reach, and impact.

## Why Commercial & Research Partnerships Matter

- **Accelerate Innovation:** Collaborating with leading universities and research institutions gives us access to cutting-edge technology, top talent, and new ideas.
- **Expand Market Reach:** Commercial partners help us scale faster, enter new markets, and build credibility with enterprise customers.
- **Mutual Value Creation:** We look for partnerships where both sides gain—whether through co-development, shared data, joint go-to-market, or pilot programs.
- **Flywheel Effect:** Each successful partnership strengthens our ecosystem, attracts more partners, and increases the value of our platform for everyone involved.

## Potential Partnerships in Discussion

  Exploring commercial pilots and integration opportunities to bring our solutions to new industry verticals.
