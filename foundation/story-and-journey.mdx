## How We Met (The Unlikely Beginning)

Picture this: Hong Kong, 2015. Three college kids from totally different worlds somehow become best friends during one of the city's most divided times.

Dennis was the tech guy studying Enterprise Information Systems. Ben was the physics nerd. David was learning hotel management and happened to be Dennis's roommate. What brought us together? We all ended up in student government right when Hong Kong was falling apart politically.

Ben became president of the China Student Association. Dennis was president of the Student Union at Hong Kong Polytechnic. Normally, these two groups couldn't even be in the same room without fighting—the tension between mainland and local students was that bad after everything that happened in 2014.

But somehow, Ben and Dennis just clicked. While everyone else was arguing and boycotting each other's events, these two were planning joint activities and actually talking like human beings. They became the last student presidents who could work together instead of treating each other like enemies.

Here's the funny part: Dennis was actually a terrible student academically, but somehow became the most famous guy on campus. Why? Because his face was constantly getting plastered on walls by students complaining about his decisions. That's democracy for you!

## Life Scattered Us (But Couldn't Break Us Apart)

As Hong Kong got worse, we all went our separate ways. Ben and David headed to America—Ben dove deep into AI with his master's and PhD at Duke, while David collected degrees like Pokémon cards (CS, Data Science, and Accounting from Georgia). 

Dennis stayed in Hong Kong for a while, diving headfirst into the startup ecosystem. He bounced around multiple startups as a founding engineer and product manager, learning the ropes of building companies from the ground up. But eventually, even he had to escape to Vancouver when staying in Hong Kong became impossible.

That's where Dennis met Rachel—she was his Airbnb landlord, and they became great friends. Turns out Rachel was another Pokémon collector when it came to degrees: JD plus a Master's in CS. Meanwhile, we all stayed close despite the distance. Real friendship doesn't care about time zones.

## The Moment Everything Changed

July 2024. One of our family members got scammed. Just like that, someone we loved lost money to these heartless criminals.

Then we heard about something even more terrifying: a Hong Kong company got tricked out of $200 million by a fake video call with their CEO. Not a real person pretending to be the CEO—an AI deepfake so convincing that smart business people handed over everything.

That's when it hit us. AI wasn't just changing the world for the better. It was giving scammers superpowers.

## The Crazy Part

Years earlier, Dennis had randomly bought the domain "scam.ai" just because it sounded cool. He had no business plan, no startup dreams—just thought it was a neat website name. Looking back, it feels like the universe was preparing us for this fight.

## We Jumped In (Consequences Be Damned)

By December, we were building. Not just talking or planning—actually creating something that could stop these AI scammers. Dennis's years in Hong Kong's startup trenches suddenly made perfect sense—all that experience as a founding engineer and PM was training for this moment. When we launched on Product Hunt in January, we hit Product of the Day. People were hungry for a solution.

Sadly, David had to step away because of visa issues. We'll always be grateful for everything he contributed to getting us started.

## The Rejection Tour

We applied to every big-name accelerator you've heard of. Got to final rounds everywhere. Got rejected everywhere too.

Then Berkeley SkyDeck happened—less than 1% of applicants get in. Twenty-plus advisors grilled us for hours. Our advisors Alex and Eric watched us do a live deepfake impersonation of VC partner Chon, which was both terrifying and hilarious. They saw firsthand how easy it is to fool people with AI.

But we knew the hard truth: being able to demonstrate the problem is very different from building a business that solves it.

## We Bet Everything

Here's what this mission means to us:

Ben walked away from a half-million-dollar job at Meta. Dennis and Rachel left their comfortable six-figure lives in Vancouver. We're not doing this for money—if we wanted easy cash, we could just become scammers ourselves. The tools are all there, and it's disgustingly profitable.

Instead, we chose the harder path. We chose to be the good guys.

## Why This Matters

Every day, regular people lose their life savings to scammers who now have AI superpowers. Businesses get tricked out of millions by fake video calls. Elderly people hear their "grandchildren" begging for money in voices that sound exactly right but are completely fake.

We started as three unlikely friends who learned to build bridges when our whole city was burning with division. Now we're using those same skills to build a bridge between AI innovation and human safety.

This isn't just our startup story. This is our fight. And we're not backing down.
