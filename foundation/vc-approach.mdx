# VC Approach

Our philosophy and strategy for external investment

## Our Core Philosophy

**Building a sustainable business comes first. Fundraising is a tool, not the goal.**

We believe in creating real value through product-market fit and sustainable revenue before seeking external capital. While we're open to VC funding when it accelerates our mission, we prioritize business fundamentals over fundraising milestones.

## Business-First Mindset

- **Sustainability Over Speed:** We focus on building a profitable, sustainable business model rather than burning cash for growth at any cost
- **Product-Market Fit Priority:** Achieving strong PMF and market validation takes precedence over fundraising timelines
- **Revenue-Driven Growth:** We prioritize customers who pay for real value over vanity metrics that look good to investors

## Current VC Engagement Status

We've had several VC approaches and conversations, but our consistent response has been:

> **"Please wait until August for more market validation."**

This timeline allows us to:
- Complete our pilot program targets (5 big corp + 33 medium size pilots)
- Demonstrate clear product-market fit with paying customers
- Show sustainable revenue growth and business model validation
- Approach fundraising from a position of strength, not necessity

## What We Look For in VCs

### 1. **Mission & Values Alignment** üéØ
- VCs who genuinely understand and support our anti-scam mission
- Investors who care about social impact alongside financial returns
- Partners who appreciate the importance of digital safety and fraud prevention

### 2. **Teammate Mentality** ü§ù
- VCs who treat us as partners, not just portfolio companies
- Investors who offer strategic guidance, not just capital
- Partners who are accessible and responsive when we need support

### 3. **Cross-Collaboration Opportunities** üîÑ
- VCs with portfolio companies that could benefit from our solutions
- Investors who can facilitate partnerships and customer introductions
- Partners who create synergies across their investment ecosystem

### 4. **Long-Term Perspective** üìà
- VCs who understand that building category-defining companies takes time
- Investors who support sustainable growth over unsustainable scaling
- Partners who align with our vision of creating lasting competitive advantages

## Our Ideal VC Partnership

We're not looking for just money‚Äîwe're seeking strategic partners who:

- **Add Strategic Value:** Beyond capital, they bring industry expertise, network access, and operational guidance
- **Respect Our Timeline:** They understand our August validation milestone and support our business-first approach
- **Share Our Vision:** They see the massive opportunity in AI-powered fraud prevention and want to build something meaningful
- **Enable Cross-Pollination:** They can connect us with complementary companies, customers, and talent

## Why August Matters

By August, we'll have:
- **Proven Market Demand:** 5 big corp brand pilots + 33 medium size pilots
- **Revenue Validation:** Paying customers demonstrating willingness to pay
- **Product-Market Fit Evidence:** Clear signals that our solution solves real problems
- **Competitive Positioning:** Established moat through our ScamDB and detection capabilities

This positions us to fundraise from strength, ensuring we get the right partners at the right valuation with the right terms.

## The Bottom Line

We're building a company that can succeed with or without VC funding. When we do raise, it will be to accelerate a proven business model with partners who truly understand and support our mission. Quality of partnership matters more than quantity of capital.
